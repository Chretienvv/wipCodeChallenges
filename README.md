# wipCodeChallenges
This repository contains my code that is unoptimised for the challenges like CodeWars, AdventOfCode etc. 


#Advent of Code
Currently I am working on the advent of code 2021. My unoptimized code is shown. In a later stage I want to show both the optimized and unoptimized code in this repository.

#Codewars 
This is my code wars link: https://www.codewars.com/users/Chr√©tien
I like to do some code kata's, but for now my focus is on the advent of code
